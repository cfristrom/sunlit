# Sunlit 3.0

## Overview
Publish photos to your own blog — hosted by Micro.blog or compatible blogs using WordPress or Micropub — and discover beautiful photos from other users. Sunlit 3.0 is a complete rewrite, improving the UI for discovery and creating blog posts with multiple photos and blocks of text.

For the current shipping version of Sunlit available in the App Store, please see [sunlit.io](https://sunlit.io/).
